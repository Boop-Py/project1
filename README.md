# Project 1

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

My project contains several files which includes: 

application.py, which contains all of the project's functionality- it sets up the environment and configures apps. It also contains the python involved in retrieving information from the html. 

create.py creates the database models for models.py.

helpers.py contains a decorator which means that a login is required to access a page.

import.py is a script that goes through the books in books.csv and adds them to the database.
